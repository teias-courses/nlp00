# Late Policy
* You have free 8 late days.
* You can use late days for assignments. A late day extends the deadline 24 hours.
* Once you have used all 8 late days, the penalty is 10% for each additional late day.

# Notes
* Students who audit this course should submit their assignments to be qualified for attending the rest of the sessions.
* Finding any sort of copying will zero down that assignment grade and also will be counted as two negative assignment points for your final score.
