With this intuition in mind, many \"old school\" approaches to constructing word vectors relied on word counts. Here we elaborate upon one of those strategies, *co-occurrence matrices* (for more information, see [here](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/lec/vectorsemantics.video.pdf) or [here](https://medium.com/data-science-group-iitr/word-embedding-2d05d270b285))."

In particular, we will run *SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)*, which is a kind of generalized *PCA (Principal Components Analysis)* to select the top $k$ principal components. Here's a visualization of dimensionality reduction with SVD. In this picture our co-occurrence matrix is $A$ with $n$ rows corresponding to $n$ words. We obtain a full matrix decomposition, with the singular values ordered in the diagonal $S$ matrix, and our new, shorter length-$k$ word vectors in $U_k$.\n",

If you want to learn more thoroughly about PCA or SVD, these course notes provide a great high-level treatment of these general purpose algorithms: [1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/l/l7.pdf), [2](http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/s15/l/l8.pdf), [3](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/l/l9.pdf). Though, for the purpose of this class, you only need to know how to extract the k-dimensional embeddings by utilizing pre-programmed implementations of these algorithms from the numpy, scipy, or sklearn python packages. In practice, it is challenging to apply full SVD to large corpora because of the memory needed to perform PCA or SVD. However, if you only want the top $k$ vector components for relatively small $k$ — known as *[Truncated SVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition#Truncated_SVD)* — then there are reasonably scalable techniques to compute those iteratively."
